> **Available Now.** Twingate Identity Firewall is currently available and free for up to five Kubernetes or SSH resources. For additional pricing information, please contact Twingate.

The Gateway is part of [Twingate Identity Firewall](https://www.twingate.com/docs/identity-firewall). It is a Layer 7 reverse proxy deployed within your environment that enables identity propagation and comprehensive auditing for upstream services such as Kubernetes API servers and SSH servers.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/kLE9txLo8Kg?si=iUrjzFuILMwnWCVI&t=1038) | [Wiki](https://github.com/Twingate/gateway/wiki) | [How It Works](https://github.com/Twingate/gateway/wiki/How-It-Works)

## Key Benefits

- **Seamless Identity Propagation:** Passes user identity through to upstream services, eliminating double authentication and removing the need for plaintext credentials on end-user machines.
- **Compliance-Ready Auditing:** All user activity is logged and attributed to specific identities, with session recording and replay for forensic review and compliance requirements.
- **Simplified Policy Management:** A unified policy engine governs both network and application access, reducing management overhead and eliminating credential sprawl.

## Supported Protocols

### Kubernetes

Secure access to private Kubernetes clusters with identity propagation, RBAC integration, and session recording for `kubectl` commands.
